  up.full_name,
  up.role,
  up.department_id,
  COUNT(o.id) as opportunity_count
FROM user_profiles up
LEFT JOIN opportunities o ON o.owner_id = up.user_id
WHERE up.department_id = (
  SELECT department_id 
  FROM user_profiles 
  WHERE email = 'your_manager_email@company.com'  -- REPLACE THIS!
)
GROUP BY up.full_name, up.role, up.department_id;
```

**Expected:** Only shows users from Manager's department

JOIN user_profiles up ON up.user_id = o.owner_id
WHERE up.email = 'your_am_email@company.com'  -- REPLACE THIS!
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:** All opportunities belong to same AM

‚úÖ PASS: All rows show same owner (the AM)  
‚ùå FAIL: Shows opportunities from different people
