# 🔍 Audit Results - All Levels (Head → Manager → Account Manager)

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Auditor:** AI Assistant  
**Scope:** Complete system audit from Head to Account Manager

---

## 📊 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### ✅ **What's Working**
1. ✅ Target assignment flow (Head → Manager → AM)
2. ✅ Sales Summary for all roles
3. ✅ Revenue & Margin calculation (after recent fixes)
4. ✅ Project creation auto-closing opportunities (trigger implemented)
5. ✅ Account Manager individual dashboard
6. ✅ Manager Team Dashboard with period selector
7. ✅ Console.log cleanup (51+ logs removed)
8. ✅ Pipeline views for Manager
9. ✅ Forecasting for Manager

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues Found**
1. ❌ **P0** - Strategic Dashboard (Head) uses MOCK DATA for managers list
2. ❌ **P1** - Activities page shows ONLY current user (Manager can't see team)
3. ❌ **P1** - Calendar shows ONLY current user (Manager can't see team)
4. ❌ **P1** - Head level uses `entity_id` while Manager/AM use `division_id`/`department_id` (potential hierarchy mismatch)

### 📈 **Overall Health Score**

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Data Flow | 80% | 🟢 Good |
| Target Management | 90% | 🟢 Excellent |
| Monitoring (Manager) | 60% | 🟡 Needs Improvement |
| Monitoring (Head) | 40% | 🔴 Critical |
| UI/UX | 85% | 🟢 Good |
| Performance | 90% | 🟢 Excellent (after cleanup) |

## 🎯 **LEVEL 1: HEAD**

### **✅ Working Features**

#### **HeadSalesSummary** (`/head/sales-summary`)
- ✅ Shows organization-wide revenue
- ✅ Top performers chart
- ✅ Revenue trend by month
- ✅ Pipeline distribution
- ✅ Export to CSV/PDF

**Hook:** `useSalesSummary.ts`
- Line 89-105: Uses `entity_id` for division-wide data
- Fallback: If no `entity_id`, shows only Head's own data

**✅ VERIFIED:** Revenue aggregation working correctly

---

### **❌ Critical Issues**

#### 1. **Strategic Dashboard** (`/head/strategic-dashboard`)
**File:** `src/pages/StrategicDashboard.tsx`

**Issue:** Line 28-34 uses **MOCK DATA** for managers!

```typescript
// Line 28-34: HARDCODED MOCK DATA! ❌
const managers = [
  { id: "all", name: "All Managers" },
  { id: "sales", name: "Sales Manager" },
  { id: "marketing", name: "Marketing Manager" },
  { id: "operations", name: "Operations Manager" },
  { id: "support", name: "Customer Support Manager" }
];
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Head cannot see REAL managers in division
- ❌ Filter dropdown shows fake data
- ❌ Cannot drill down to specific manager performance

**Priority:** **P0 - Critical**

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Should fetch REAL managers from database:
const { data: managers } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('id, full_name, department_id')
  .eq('role', 'manager')
  .eq('division_id', profile.division_id)  // if Head has division_id
  .eq('is_active', true);
```

---

#### 2. **Hierarchy Inconsistency**
**File:** `src/hooks/useSalesSummary.ts`

**Issue:** Line 89-105 - Head uses `entity_id`, but Manager/AM use `division_id`/`department_id`

```typescript
// Line 89: Head logic
if (profile.role === 'head') {
  if (profile.entity_id) {  // ← Uses entity_id
    // fetch entity members
  } else {
    query = query.eq('owner_id', user.id);  // ← Fallback: only Head's data
  }
}

// Line 63: Manager logic (different file SalesSummary.tsx)
if (profile.department_id) {  // ← Uses department_id
  // fetch department members
}
```

**Impact:**
- ⚠️ If Head doesn't have `entity_id` set, they only see their own data (not division)
- ⚠️ Potential mismatch in org hierarchy (`entity_id` vs `division_id`)

**Priority:** **P1 - High**

**Recommendation:**
- Decide: Is Head scoped by `entity_id` or `division_id`?
- Ensure consistency across all hooks and pages
- Update `useProfile` to populate correct field

---

### **❌ Critical Issues**

#### 3. **Activities Page** (`/manager/activities`)
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/SalesActivityTracker.tsx`

**Issue:** Line 100 - Only fetches current user's activities!

```typescript
// Line 100: ❌ ONLY current user!
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('sales_activity_v2')
  .select('...')
  .eq('created_by', user.id)  // ← Should include team!
  .order('scheduled_at', { ascending: false });
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Manager can only see their own activities
- ❌ Cannot monitor team's sales activities
- ❌ Missing visibility into AM customer interactions

**Priority:** **P1 - High**

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Should include team members:
const { profile } = useProfile();
let ownerIds = [user.id];

if (profile.role === 'manager') {
  // Fetch team members
  const { data: teamMembers } = await supabase
    .from('manager_team_members')
    .select('account_manager_id')
    .eq('manager_id', profile.id);
  
  const amIds = teamMembers.map(m => m.account_manager_id);
  
  const { data: amProfiles } = await supabase
    .from('user_profiles')
    .select('user_id')
    .in('id', amIds);
  
  ownerIds = [user.id, ...amProfiles.map(p => p.user_id)];
}

// Then use:
query = query.in('created_by', ownerIds);
```

---

#### 4. **Calendar Page** (`/manager/calendar`)
**File:** `src/components/CalendarView.tsx`

**Issue:** Line 45 - Only fetches current user's calendar!

```typescript
// Line 45: ❌ ONLY current user!
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('sales_activity_v2')
  .select('*')
  .eq('created_by', user.id)  // ← Should include team!
  .not('scheduled_at', 'is', null)
  .gte('scheduled_at', startDate.toISOString())
  .lte('scheduled_at', endDate.toISOString());
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Manager can only see their own calendar
- ❌ Cannot see team's scheduled activities
- ❌ Missing team coordination view

**Priority:** **P1 - High**

**Fix Required:**
Same approach as Activities - include team members' events.

## 🔄 **CROSS-LEVEL INTEGRATION**

### **Target Flow** ✅ Working

```
HEAD
  ↓ assigns target (Revenue: 10M, Margin: 1M)
MANAGER (receives 10M/1M from Head)
  ↓ assigns targets to AMs (5M+5M = 10M total)
AM1 (receives 5M) + AM2 (receives 5M)
  ↓ create opportunities & projects
DATA flows up for aggregation
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ Head can assign to Manager
- ✅ Manager can assign to AM
- ✅ Targets appear in correct dashboards
- ✅ No double-counting

---

### **Data Aggregation** ✅ Working

```
AM1: Revenue 3M, Margin 300K (won opportunities)
AM2: Revenue 2M, Margin 200K (won opportunities)
  ↓
MANAGER Dashboard:
  - Actual Revenue: 5M (3M + 2M)
  - Actual Margin: 500K (300K + 200K)
  - Target: 10M / 1M (from Head)
  - Achievement: 50% / 50%
  ↓
HEAD Dashboard:
  - Division Revenue: 5M (all Managers aggregated)
  - Division Margin: 500K
  - Top Performers: AM1, AM2
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ AM data aggregates to Manager
