## üìà **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **If Activities/Calendar is Slow:**

1. **Implement Pagination**
```typescript
// Limit to 50 activities per page
.limit(50)
.range(page * 50, (page + 1) * 50 - 1)
```

2. **Add Date Range Filter**
```typescript
// Default to last 30 days
.gte('scheduled_at', thirtyDaysAgo)
.lte('scheduled_at', today)
```

3. **Lazy Load Calendar Events**
```typescript
// Only fetch events for visible month
.gte('scheduled_at', monthStart)
.lte('scheduled_at', monthEnd)
```

---

### **If Strategic Dashboard is Slow:**

1. **Cache Manager List**
```typescript
// Cache for 5 minutes
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('id, full_name')
  .eq('role', 'manager')
  .maybeSingle();

localStorage.setItem('managers', JSON.stringify(data));
```

2. **Debounce Manager Selection**
```typescript
const handleManagerChange = debounce((managerId) => {
  // Refresh dashboard data
}, 300);
```
